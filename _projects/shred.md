**SHRED** (Shallow REcurrent Decoder) is a cutting-edge neural network architecture designed to reconstruct high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields from sparse sensor data. By integrating a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network to capture temporal dynamics and a **Shallow Decoder Network (SDN)** to map these dynamics back to the original high-dimensional space, SHRED provides a robust solution for scenarios with limited or randomly placed sensors {% cite riva2024robuststateestimationpartial %}.

## üîë Key Features

### ‚ö° Efficient Sensor Utilization
SHRED can accurately reconstruct complex spatio-temporal dynamics using as few as three sensors, even if they are randomly positioned. This capability reduces the need for large-scale sensor networks and eliminates the need for complex sensor placement optimization.

### üíª Computational Efficiency
Training SHRED on **compressed data** enables efficient computation, making it possible to run models on standard hardware without requiring extensive hyper-parameter tuning.

### üåç Versatility Across Domains
SHRED has been successfully applied in various fields, including **fluid dynamics** and **plasma physics**, proving its adaptability to different types of spatio-temporal data.

## üöÄ Recent Applications in Nuclear Reactor Monitoring

In collaboration with the **University of Washington**, we have extended SHRED for **nuclear reactor monitoring**. Using out-of-core **neutron flux measurements**, we demonstrated that SHRED can accurately reconstruct the full state vector of a reactor, including multiple coupled field variables. This advancement holds great potential for **real-time monitoring and control** in nuclear reactors, particularly in environments where in-core sensing is difficult.
