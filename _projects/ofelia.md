**MP-OFELIA** (OpenMC-FEniCSx for muLtiphysics tutorIAl) is an open-source project developed by the ERMETE Lab at Politecnico di Milano. It serves as a comprehensive educational tool designed to simulate multiphysics scenarios in nuclear engineering by integrating [OpenMC](https://openmc.org/) (version 0.13.2) and [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/) (version 0.6.0) within a Python environment {% cite LOI2024113480 %}.

**Key Features of MP-OFELIA:**

- **Comprehensive Tutorials:** MP-OFELIA offers a series of tutorials covering both single-physics and coupled multiphysics simulations. These tutorials encompass:

  - **Fluid Dynamics:** Simulations such as cavity flow, backward-facing step, and laminar flow over a cylinder.

  - **Neutronics:** Exercises including neutron transport in a pin cell and a 2D mini core model.

  - **Multiphysics Coupling:** Coupled simulations addressing thermal-hydraulics and neutronics interactions, exemplified by a pin cell with thermal feedback.

- **Educational Focus:** The project is tailored for educational purposes, providing users with hands-on experience in setting up and solving multiphysics problems relevant to nuclear reactor applications.

- **Open-Source Accessibility:** MP-OFELIA is freely available on GitHub, encouraging collaboration and further development within the scientific and educational communities.

**Recent Developments:**

- **Integration of Tutorials:** The repository consolidates tutorials from previous projects, such as the FEniCSx tutorials, into a unified platform, enhancing the learning experience for users.

MP-OFELIA exemplifies the ERMETE Lab's commitment to advancing multiphysics modeling and simulation in nuclear engineering, providing valuable resources for both students and professionals in the field.
