**MP-OFELIA** (OpenMC-FEniCSx for muLtiphysics tutorIAl) is an open-source project developed by the **ERMETE Lab** at **Politecnico di Milano**. It serves as a comprehensive educational tool for simulating multi-physics scenarios in **nuclear engineering**. By integrating **OpenMC** (version 0.13.2) and **FEniCSx** (version 0.6.0) in a Python environment, MP-OFELIA provides an intuitive and powerful framework for solving complex coupled problems in nuclear applications {% cite LOI2024113480 %}.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features of MP-OFELIA

### ðŸ“š Comprehensive Tutorials
MP-OFELIA offers a series of tutorials designed for both **single-physics** and **coupled multi-physics** simulations. These tutorials cover a wide range of scenarios:

- **Fluid Dynamics**: Simulations such as cavity flow, backward-facing step, and laminar flow over a cylinder.

- **Neutronics**: Exercises such as neutron transport in a pin cell and a 2D mini core model.

- **Multiphysics Coupling**: Simulations that address thermal-hydraulic and neutronics interactions, exemplified by a pin cell with thermal feedback.

### ðŸŽ“ Educational Focus
The project is specifically designed for educational purposes, providing users with hands-on experience in setting up and solving multi-physics problems relevant to **nuclear reactor applications**.

### ðŸ”“ Open-Source Accessibility
MP-OFELIA is freely available on **GitHub**, encouraging collaboration and further development within the scientific and educational communities.
