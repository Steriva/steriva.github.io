abstract = {The Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM), and its generalized version (GEIM), are non-intrusive, reduced-basis model order reduction methods hereby adopted and modified to address the problem of optimal placement of sensors and real-time estimation in thermo-hydraulics systems. These techniques have been used to extract the characteristic spatial modes of the system and select a set of points (or functionals) corresponding to the optimal locations for the sensors. Collecting experimental measurements in the available points allows the construction of an empirical interpolation of the fields employed to estimate the variable of interest. However, when these data are affected by noise, the (G)EIM loses its good convergence properties. In this context, stabilization techniques allow good field reconstruction even with noisy data. This work provides an alternative and effective solution to the problem of reconstructing the system state in the presence of experimental data affected by random noise by using the Tikhonov regularization technique. The developed methods have been tested on a simple thermo-fluid dynamics problem known as “two-sided lid-driven differentially heated square cavity”.}

abstract = {The problem of estimating in real-time the state of a system by combining experimental data and models has been extensively addressed in literature. In particular, there have been a lot of developments in reduced order modelling techniques integrated in a data assimilation framework. This coupling allows to reconstruct the variable of interest considering a priori knowledge (i.e. the mathematical model) and some measurements of it. However, in some engineering systems not all the variables of interest may be measurable and hence the typical framework cannot be applied. However, these methods can be extended to reconstruct the full state of a system, by means of partial observations only. In this work, a novel approach will be introduced, based on a two step method: first the measurements are used to determine the parameters describing the system; then, the full state is estimated by means of reduced order modelling techniques. This new approach will be compared with the state-of-the-art both on a simple thermal hydraulics case and on an innovative nuclear reactor design, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor.}

abstract = {Hybrid Data Assimilation (HDA) methods are a class of numerical methods that aim at integrating Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques into a Data Assimilation (DA) framework, thus combining mathematical models and experimental data. The objective is to reduce the solution time using MOR algorithms whilst keeping the accuracy of the models at the desired level using observations, which serve as an update to the a priori prediction of the model. This two-part work investigated HDA techniques by applying them to two classes of problems: numerical benchmark cases (part 1) and experimental facilities (part 2). In particular, this paper discusses the former, focusing on the numerical formulation of the methodologies and on the effect of noisy data. Indeed, real-world experimental data are always polluted by errors and uncertainties; therefore, it is critical to first assess the performance of these techniques on numerical benchmark cases with the artificial introduction of random noise before applying them to real-world experimental facilities. As such, this paper applies the Generalised Empirical Interpolation Method (GEIM) and the Parameterised-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) formulation to a non-adiabatic airflow over the classical computational fluid-dynamics benchmark of the 3D Backward Facing Step (BFS). Results show how both algorithms are valuable tools to reconstruct the state of the system when measurements are available, whilst assessing the effect of noise on the available data; in particular, the GEIM is a bit better than the PBDW since a lower reconstruction error is achieved with fewer sensors.}

HDA methods provide tools able to estimate the state of a system assuming to have measurements available per each field describing the system (e.g., neutron flux, temperature, velocity, …). However, it is not always possible to measure every field of interest for various reasons, thus these techniques should be adapted: in particular, it is legitimate to investigate the possibility of extracting some information from indirect measurement. Following the assessment of the two selected HDA methods (Generalised Empirical Interpolation Method and Parameterised Background Data-Weak) performed on a numerical benchmark test case discussed in the first part of this two-part work, the present paper now deals with their testing on a real-world experimental facility and their validation with experimental data. This work represents the first step for a deep validation phase to assess their efficiency and reliability, applying the Generalised Empirical Interpolation Method (GEIM), the Parameterised-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) formulation and the Indirect Reconstruction (IR) algorithm to DYNASTY, an experimental facility for studying natural circulation built at Politecnico di Milano. The robustness of these methods is high when the models are accurate, however when real system are analysed the model discrepancy can be present and these techniques may suffer.}

In this methodology, the incompressible Euler equations are thus substituted by the Schrödinger equation, turning a quasi-linear Partial Differential Equation into a linear one, an algorithm known in the literature as Incompressible Schrödinger Flow. Previous works on the subject used the Fast Fourier Transform method to solve this problem, obtaining promising results, especially in predicting vortex dynamics; this paper aims to implement this novel approach into a Finite Element framework to find a more general formulation better suited for future application on complex geometries and on test cases closer to real-world applications. Simple case studies are presented in this work to analyze the potentialities of this method: the results obtained confirm that this method could potentially have some advantages over traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics method, especially for what concerns computational savings related to the required time discretization, whilst also introducing new aspects of the algorithm, mainly related to boundary conditions, not addressed in previous works.}",

abstract = {Sensor positioning and real-time estimation of non-observable fields is an open question in the nuclear sector, especially for advanced nuclear reactors. In Circulating Fuel Reactors (CFR), liquid fuel and coolant are homogeneously mixed, and thus these reactors will not have internal structures, making sensor positioning in the primary circuit, including the core, an unresolved problem, making most of the core blind to sensors. Thus, the possibility of estimating the system state in the whole domain using a few local measurements has important implications for safety, monitoring, and control both in nominal and accidental conditions. In this context, the integrated Model Order Reduction and Data Assimilation framework offers intriguing opportunities to reliably combine experimental data and background knowledge from a reduced mathematical model. This work discusses and applies innovative methods within this framework, based on the Generalized Empirical Interpolation and the Indirect Reconstruction algorithms, to a proposed concept of CFR. This work aims to identify the optimal sensor positioning within the core and assess the feasibility of reconstructing the quantities of interest starting only from transient sparse data on fuel temperature, possibly noisy, and testing the predictive capabilities of the discussed methods.}

Neutron physics and thermal hydraulics are of great importance in this framework, their interdependence being the most fundamental coupling effect in nuclear reactors, as their interaction determines the power and temperature profiles, being quantities of interest during the design and safety analysis phases. This work focuses on developing a fully open-source multi-physics and multi-scale tool capable of determining the temperature profile of a characteristic fuel pin of a PWR when the power generated by the system is known. This methodology is implemented in a Python environment coupling the open source library FEniCSx for the thermal-hydraulic analysis with the OpenMC Monte Carlo code for the description of the fissionable system: regarding the former, FEniCSx handles the thermal calculations, whereas a 1D model is used to predict the axial coolant temperature distribution. The coupling applies an explicit method, whose convergence is based on a Picard scheme, using an adaptive relaxation scheme. This coupling strategy is compared with literature data, providing a good agreement with a fully Multi-Physics solver.}

Nevertheless, the development of accurate and stable models remains a challenging task despite the advancements in computational hardware and software. This work investigates the possibility of combining the available mathematical model with data collected on physical systems, with a two-fold goal: improvement of the performance of the former from the computational point of view without sacrificing accuracy and performing model bias correction with the knowledge coming in real-time from the system. In particular, two Data-Driven Reduced Order Modelling techniques, the Generalised Empirical Interpolation Method and the Parametrised-Background Data-Weak formulation, are applied to literature benchmark nuclear case studies, as they were observed to be quite well suited for the chosen cases. The main goal of this work is to assess the possibility of using external data to perform model bias correction: starting from a purposefully less accurate, but computationally cheaper base model, then using high-fidelity data to update and correct the model efficiently. Indeed, the numerical results obtained in this paper are promising, confirming the feasibility of this approach to develop computationally cheap and accurate multi-physics models; furthermore, investigation of Data-Driven Reduced Order Modelling approach to nuclear industrial cases, in the context of model bias correction, is foreseen.}

This theory plays a pivotal role in the framework of magnetic confinement fusion, where it can be applied to describe both thermonuclear plasmas confined inside the vacuum vessel and operating fluids, such as liquid metals and molten salts, flowing within the blanket of future tokamaks. Currently, the state-of-the-art numerical modeling of MHD scenarios employs a multi-physics framework to examine the interplay between magnetic fields and thermal hydraulics; however, due to the complexity of the involved physics, detailed models are required, resulting in a significant computational burden. In this regard, reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques may represent a promising solution, as they enable approximating complex systems with lower-dimensional models. Indeed, ROM methodologies can significantly reduce the required computational time while maintaining accuracy in capturing the convoluted physics involved in fusion reactors, especially in the contexts of sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and control. Despite their potential, ROM methods are relatively under-explored within the MHD framework; this study applies ROM techniques to MHD scenarios, focusing on their capabilities and possible limitations. To this aim, the backward-facing step, which is well suited for exploring the effects of different magnetic fields on turbulent dynamics, is adopted as case study. In particular, this work evaluates the potentialities of the ROM approach in enhancing computational efficiency within the MHD domain. Each of the methods evaluated was effective in precisely reconstructing flow dynamics at any given time and across the full range of magnetic field values tested while significantly reducing computational costs compared to full-order simulations. Practically, this study demonstrates the feasibility to create simplified models that accurately represent the magnetohydrodynamic flows of fluids within the blanket.}",

  abstract={Reliable, real-time state estimation in nuclear reactors is of critical importance for monitoring, control and safety. It further empowers the development of digital twins that are sufficiently accurate for real-world deployment. As nuclear engineering systems are typically characterised by extreme environments, their in-core sensing is a challenging task, even more so in Generation-IV reactor concepts, which feature molten salt or liquid metals as thermal carriers. The emergence of data-driven methods allows for new techniques for accurate and robust estimation of the full state space vector characterising the reactor (mainly composed by neutron fluxes and the thermal-hydraulics fields). These techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, in order to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the Shallow Recurrent Decoder (SHRED) architecture to estimate the entire state vector of a reactor from three, out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. Specifically, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor, in the EVOL geometry (Evaluation and Viability of Liquid Fuel Fast Reactor System project), is demonstrated as a test case, with neutron flux measurements alone allowing for reconstruction of the 20 coupled field variables of the dynamics. This approach can further quantify the uncertainty associated with the state estimation due to its considerably low training cost on compressed data. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin. },
