I am a PhD candidate in *Energy and Nuclear Science and Technology* at Politecnico di Milano. My research focuses on advanced data-driven techniques for state estimation in nuclear reactors, combining reduced-order modeling, machine learning and data assimilation methods.

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Nuclear Engineering (*cum laude*) from Politecnico di Milano, where my thesis explored reduced basis methods for data assimilation in thermal-hydraulic systems. I have developed tools like **pyforce**, a Python framework for data-driven model reduction in multi-physics problems, and collaborate to **NuSHRED**, a shallow recurrent decoder for nuclear reactor applications.

In October 2024, I began a six-month research internship at the University of Washington, exploring machine learning applications in state estimation under the guidance of Prof. J. Nathan Kutz.
