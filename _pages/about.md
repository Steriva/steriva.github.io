**About Me**

I am a PhD candidate in *Energy and Nuclear Science and Technology* at Politecnico di Milano. My research is focused on advanced data-driven techniques for state estimation in nuclear reactors, combining reduced-order modeling, machine learning, and data assimilation methods to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of reactor monitoring systems.

**Academic Background**
I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Nuclear Engineering (*cum laude*) from Politecnico di Milano. My thesis explored reduced basis methods for data assimilation in thermal-hydraulic systems, where I developed innovative tools for improving simulation accuracy in complex systems.

**Research & Projects**
I have contributed to the development of pyforce, a Python framework for data-driven model reduction in multi-physics problems, which leverages cutting-edge techniques to improve computational efficiency. I also collaborate on the NuSHRED project, which focuses on using shallow recurrent decoders for state estimation in nuclear reactors, enabling real-time monitoring with limited sensor data.

**Current Endeavors**
In October 2024, I started a six-month research internship at the University of Washington, where I am further exploring machine learning applications in state estimation, working under the guidance of Prof. J. Nathan Kutz.
